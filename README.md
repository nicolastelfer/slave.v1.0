# slave.v1.0
This repo migrates the current Shopify site into the new Slate framewoork

## Context:

Shopify theming can be quite challenging for developers. It uses a lot of liquid templates (Shopify's language) and in most cases quite restricting. 

Slate is a framwork that makes development a lot easier. Split code and live reload are just a few of the improvements for developers to create faster code. 

### Main benefits of this migration:

Improve code structure, faster coding AND reduce page load by usnig code-splitting techniques. 


## Slate:

Slate is still in Beta mode, so before it can be put live it needs to be stable. 


### Current status of this repo:

Still migrating code into Slate, testing that code splitting works as intended.
